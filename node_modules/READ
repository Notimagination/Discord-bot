Here you must put the necessary libraries for the bot to work, as there are several libraries, I am not going to spend the time writing them 1 by 1

with a minimum of knowledge about this, you will know what they are

PD: the libraries will download automatically with the corresponding command, so you basically don't need to do anything but write the command ðŸ˜ƒ
