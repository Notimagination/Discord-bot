# Discord-bot

This bot was my first big project, since 2019.

I have not been very active in this project, since it did not receive the support that I thought it could have. 

Due to the constant changes that Discord makes, this project has become very outdated (but still fully functional), so there are many things to do/finish, as well as many bugs that are not fixed.


`I give all the permissions so that anyone who wants to implement code and/or any idea of my bot can do so freely`

I'm just going to tell you two things that are needed to run the bot:

- [Discord JS](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/general/welcome) librarie
* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/es/) server enviorement

`From now on I clarify that I am not going to give any type of support, in any area. So don't try to ask me something related to this`

This bot is not for people who don't have even a minimal, very minimal programming idea, so the copy-paste is only your responsability.
