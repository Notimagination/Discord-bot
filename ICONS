Here are all the emotes the bot uses for each feature. They were all taken from the internet, but many others I had to make changes to them, so it could be said that I "create" them.

I think it goes without saying that for them to take effect, these emotes must be uploaded to a Discord server, if possible with the default name, since that would work without problems, if you want to change their name, you will have to take work to do it in code too

Greetings!
